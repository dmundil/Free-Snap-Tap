# Snap-Tap
Python based Snap Tapping program which is usable for all keyboards and not only for Razer or Wooting keyboards.
Snap Tapping is when the last input of e.g. a direction key will always be prioritized even when the opposing direction key is still pressed.

Tap Grouping can be defined in the py file under '# Tap Groups'. (Just Add or remove new lists with the keys as chars.)
Tap Groupings are a set of keys that are observed and the output of each group is seperately handled.


Tested with Python 12.4.
